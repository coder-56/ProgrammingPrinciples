# ProgrammingPrinciples

There are certain principles that makes programmer's life easy. In this repo, will be talking about these principles. Programming principles and design patterns are differnt. We are going to conver design patterns in next tutorial.

	• S - Single-responsiblity Principle. ( Separation of concerns )
	• O - Open-closed Principle. ( open for extension, but closed for modification_
	• L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP - if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S)
	• I - Interface Segregation Principle (Reduce fat interfaces into multiple smaller and more specific client specific interfaces)
	• D - Dependency Inversion Principle. (hides information (i.e. implementation details) by providing an interface,)
	• KISS - keep it simple and stupid
	• don't implement something until it is necessary
	• Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work
	• Keep things DRY - Don't repeat yourself. Duplication can lead to maintenance nightmares
	• Code For The Maintainer - Don't make me think.
	• Avoid Premature Optimization - thinking about noncritical parts
	• Minimise Coupling and Maximise Cohesion- Coupling between modules/components 
	• Talk via interfaces 
	• Compose when there is a "has a" (or "uses a") relationship, inherit when "is a".
	• The basic idea of orthogonality is that things that are not related conceptually should not be related in the system.
	• Encapsulate What Changes  - most likely to change and encapsulates them behind an API
	• With each commit make sure it does not degrade the codebase quality.
  •  Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. Murphy's Law
